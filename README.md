The project has been made into a GUI for better interactive and ease purpose.
The Project delves into NLP concepts and the pre-processing involved before training a Logistic Regression model.
Visualization includes using the Word cloud mapping for the user-selected sentiment.
The Text to Vector conversion is done using Bag of Words
Next steps:
1. To see the difference in metrics if Word2Vec is used. Read that Word2Vec is better in highlighting the sentiments involved in the text.
2. Implement XGBooost model
3. Create a new button to select models
